this is a small 2d Game written in c
i used minilibx library.

a map is provided, all i did is .. i used that map file to change it to a graphical 2d map by converting the map file content to a 2D array and keep track of each character and display its equivalent png image.
all this is done after parsing the map content to check that the map is valid.
 
example :


**$> Game map.ber**
